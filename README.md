# JavaScriptZombiesGame
A single page game, with a hidden grid, inspired to build it by my students when teaching a JavaScript class.

I wrote this about 5 years ago (2011-2012) while teaching Computer Programming for a Dept of Defense course in Pensacola, FL.  JavaScript was part of the curriculum, several of my students asked (more like challenged) me to make a Walking Dead genre game in JS. This was the result.

-- Other than mini-scripts, client side hacks, etc, this was the most I'd ever done with JavaScript

-- It's functional, but not complete and (of course) has bugs. Many of them are known (as I wanted to see if my students would find them), but I'm sure there are others I'm not aware of.

-- The code is self-documenting, as I tend to use very descriptive names for variable & function names. So actual comments are sparse.

-- *Known Issue* It's NOT very cross-browser compatible. Prior to this project, I wasn't aware that Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc. had different methods for detecting keystrokes. So the *function checkArrowKeys(e)* function is Chrome specific.
